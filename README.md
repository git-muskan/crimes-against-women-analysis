# crimes-against-women-analysis
This project analyzes crimes committed against women from 2001 to 2014, using data to generate insights that can drive change. It includes a clustering process to categorize states into safe and unsafe zones based on crime rates, highlighting areas of concern and potential for improvement.

Key Objectives
Analyze Historical Data: Examine crime data from 2001 to 2014 to identify patterns and trends.
Clustering for Safety Classification: Use K-means clustering to classify states into 'safe' and 'unsafe' zones based on crime rates.
Predict Future Crime Rates: Employ Random Forest regression to forecast future crime rates and identify areas at risk.
Visualize Data: Create visualizations to depict crime trends and state-wise safety levels.
